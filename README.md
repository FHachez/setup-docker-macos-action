# Setup Docker on macOS action [![.github/workflows/test.yml](https://github.com/douglascamata/setup-docker-macos-action/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/douglascamata/setup-docker-macos-action/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This action installs Docker on a macOS runner through [Colima], [Lima-VM], and [Homebrew].

[colima]: https://github.com/abiosoft/colima
[lima-vm]: https://github.com/lima-vm/lima
[homebrew]: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew

I intend this action to be kept as simple as possible:

- No other OS will be supported.
- No other installation method for Colima will be supported (means you will always get what Homebrew gives you).

## Features

- Safety check to ensure the action is running in macOS.
- Caches big Homebrew packages to save some CI minutes.

## Outputs

## `colima-version`

The version of Colima that was installed.

## `docker-client-version`

The version of the Docker client that was installed.
